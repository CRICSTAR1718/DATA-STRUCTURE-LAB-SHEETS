**Overview**
This repository contains a collection of lab sheets and sample solutions for a Data Structures course. Each lab sheet provides practical exercises on core data structure concepts, implementations, and analysis, helping students reinforce theoretical knowledge through hands-on programming tasks.

**Lab Topics**
Arrays: Static and dynamic arrays, basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Linked Lists: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, including basic CRUD operations.
Stacks and Queues: Implementation of stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists.
Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).
Graphs: Graph representations, BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, binary search, etc.
